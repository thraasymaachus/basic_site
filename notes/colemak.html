        <p>Colemak is a keyboard layout, but not just any ordinary one... It optimizes your typing speed. The most commonly used letters are on the home row, meaning that your fingers don't need to do as much work. It also tries to minimise the frequency of same-finger bigrams. This means that labour is divided more fairly among fingers. With these factors, and enough practice touch-typing, your words per minute (WPM) can be very high.</p>


        <h2>Good things to remember</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Try to move your fingers back to the home row between strokes</li>
            <li>If you have a mechanical keyboard, physically rearrange the keys</li>
            <li>Don't 'cheat' by using the wrong finger for a key-- it will only slow you down</li>
        </ul>
